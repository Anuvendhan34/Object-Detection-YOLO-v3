# Object-Detection-YOLO-v3
Features:
      => Pre-trained Weights: Use COCO dataset weights for out-of-the-box detection.
      =>Custom Training: Train YOLOv3 on your custom dataset.
      =>Real-time Detection: Run object detection on videos or live streams.
      =>Flexible Input: Support for image, video, or webcam feeds.
      =>Visualizations: Annotated bounding boxes with labels and confidence scores.

Dependencies:
Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

      =>Python >= 3.7
      =>OpenCV
      =>NumPy
      =>TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on the framework used)
      =>Matplotlib

Install the required packages using:
==>[pip install -r requirements.txt]  

The Steps Need To Be Follow:

1.Clone the Repository:
==>[git clone https://github.com/your_username/yolo-v3-object-detection.git  
cd yolo-v3-object-detection ]

2. Download Pre-trained Weights:
[Download the YOLOv3 weights from the official YOLO website or use weights for a custom-trained model. Place the weights in the weights/ directory.]

3.Run Object Detection:
(I)On An Image:
[python detect.py --input data/sample.jpg --output results/output.jpg ]

(II)On a Video:
[python detect.py --input data/video.mp4 --output results/output.mp4  ]

(III)From Webcam:
[python detect.py --webcam  ]

4. Train a Custom Model (Optional):
Refer to the train.py script for training YOLOv3 on a custom dataset.
Modify the configuration files as needed and place your labeled data in the appropriate directory.
